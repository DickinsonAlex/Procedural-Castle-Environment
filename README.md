# 🏰 Procedural Castle Environment – Houdini to Unreal Workflow

This project is a procedurally generated medieval castle scene built in Unreal Engine 5 using Houdini Engine. The castle, terrain, and supplementary props were all generated with parameterized tools, allowing for dynamic variation at runtime. Designed as a demonstration of PCG principles, the scene emphasizes structural cohesion, visual quality, and modular reusability.

✅ Core Features
- Castle Generator: Fully parameterized Houdini Digital Asset (HDA) for castle layout and architecture
- Runtime Variation: Castle can be regenerated along with the environment
- UE5 Integration: Assets imported and rendered using Nanite, Lumen, and native Unreal terrain/water tools
- Scene Polish: Post-processing, lighting, and camera flythrough sequences

🧠 Enhancements
- Houdini-Driven Infrastructure: Houses, towers, and wall segments controlled by spline and instancing logic
- Reference-Based Design: Inspired by real-world medieval architecture and games like Manor Lords
- Cohesive Aesthetic: Unified visual tone through controlled asset variation and environment sculpting
